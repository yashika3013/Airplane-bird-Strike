# Airplane-bird-Strike
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes wildlife collision data to determine factors affecting vehicle damage. We validate insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using statistical tests.

ðŸ”¬ Objective
Bird strikes pose a significant risk to aviation safety, leading to potential damage, flight disruptions, and 
financial losses. The goal of this analysis is to predict whether a bird strike will cause damage to an aircraft 
based on various factors such as altitude, weather conditions, aircraft type, and wildlife species. 
The primary objectives are to develop a model to classify bird strike incidents, enhance safety by reducing 
damage risks, optimize costs by targeting high-risk scenarios, and support regulatory compliance through 
data-driven risk assessments.

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights
âœ” Most bird strikes do not cause damage, but severe cases exist.
âœ” Takeoff & landing are the most vulnerable flight phases.
âœ” Larger birds like Canada Goose pose higher risks.
âœ” Strikes vary across locations, with some airports and states more affected.
âœ” Larger aircraft with more engines offer better protection.
âœ” Improved safety measures can reduce costs, disruptions, and enhance aviation safety.

ðŸ“ˆ Statistical Validation of EDA
EDA insights were verified using statistical tests to ensure reliability:
Chi-square test for categorical variable relationships.
ANOVA & t-tests to compare means for numerical variables.

Model Development & Performance
The final model is a Voting Classifier combining:
âœ… Decision Tree (DT)
âœ… XGBoost (XGB)
âœ… LightGBM

ðŸ”¥ Performance Highlights
Model is well-generalized and captures key patterns.
Accuracy: 92%
Recall: 54%
Recall is relatively lower, which can be concerning for safety-critical decisions. Future improvements will focus on enhancing recall to reduce false negatives.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Statsmodels & SciPy for statistical tests
Jupyter Notebook for analysis
