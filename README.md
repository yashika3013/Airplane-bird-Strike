# Airplane-bird-Strike
ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
This project analyzes wildlife collision data to determine factors affecting vehicle damage. We validate insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using statistical tests.

ðŸ“Š Dataset
Source: Kaggle - Airplane Bird Strikes


ðŸ”¬ Objective
Bird strikes pose a significant risk to aviation safety, leading to potential damage, flight disruptions, and financial losses.
The goals of this analysis:
âœ… Predict whether a bird strike will cause damage.
âœ… Identify key risk factors (altitude, weather, aircraft type, wildlife species).
âœ… Enhance safety by minimizing damage risks.
âœ… Optimize costs by focusing on high-risk scenarios.
âœ… Support regulatory compliance through data-driven risk assessments.

ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Insights
âœ” Most bird strikes do not cause damage, but severe cases exist.
âœ” Takeoff & landing are the most vulnerable flight phases.
âœ” Larger birds like Canada Goose pose higher risks.
âœ” Strikes vary across locations, with some airports & states more affected.
âœ” Larger aircraft with more engines offer better protection.
âœ” Improved safety measures can reduce costs, disruptions, and enhance aviation safety.

ðŸ“ˆ Statistical Validation of EDA
EDA insights were verified using statistical tests:
ðŸ“Œ Chi-square test â†’ To assess relationships between categorical variables.
ðŸ“Œ ANOVA & t-tests â†’ To compare means for numerical variables.

ðŸ¤– Model Development & Performance
The final model is a Voting Classifier combining:
âœ… Decision Tree (DT)
âœ… XGBoost (XGB)
âœ… LightGBM

ðŸ”¥ Performance Highlights
âœ” Accuracy: 92%
âœ” Recall: 54% (Future improvements will focus on recall to reduce false negatives.)
âœ” Model is well-generalized and captures key patterns in bird strikes.

ðŸš€ Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
Statsmodels & SciPy for statistical tests
Jupyter Notebook for analysis
